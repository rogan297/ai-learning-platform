## Platform Overview

This project provides the complete infrastructure required to deploy a
fully AI-driven learning environment, designed to scale and adapt to
each individual user.

The system goes beyond a simple assistant: it automatically deploys
specialized intelligent agents based on the primary subject the user
wants to learn. These agents do not just teach --- they learn alongside
the student, dynamically adapting content depth, pace, and teaching
style according to the learner's progress and preferences.

As the user progresses, the agent:

-   Analyzes learning evolution and comprehension level\
-   Suggests improvements and new learning paths\
-   Adjusts methodology according to learning style (visual, practical,
    theoretical, etc.)\
-   Builds a personalized and progressive learning experience

The result is a living, adaptive, and personalized educational
experience where AI evolves together with the student.
